Security: Fix world-readable permissions on new `.htpasswd` files

On startup the rest-server Docker container creates an empty `.htpasswd` file
if none exists yet. This file was world-readable by default, which can be
a security risk, even though the file only contains hashed passwords.

This has been fixed such that new `.htpasswd` files are no longer world-readabble.

The permissions of existing `.htpasswd` files must be manually changed if
relevant in your setup.
